### Target Users

#### Primary Stakeholders
1. **Clients (Care Recipients)**
   - View care schedules and upcoming visits
   - Track budget utilization
   - Access visit history and care notes
   - Manage personal profile and preferences

2. **Care Workers (Healthcare Providers)**
   - Access daily schedules and client information
   - Check-in/check-out from visits
   - Document care activities and notes
   - Offline functionality for field work

3. **Administrators (Healthcare Coordinators)**
   - Manage user accounts and permissions
   - Oversee care plan implementation
   - Generate reports and analytics
   - Ensure compliance and quality standards
