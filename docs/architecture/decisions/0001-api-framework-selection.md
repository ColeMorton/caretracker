# ADR-0001: API Framework Selection

**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2025-09-18
**Deciders**: Development Team, Architecture Review Board
**Technical Story**: Phase 1 API framework selection for CareTracker healthcare management system

## Context and Problem Statement

CareTracker requires a high-performance, type-safe Node.js backend framework for handling healthcare data with strict performance, security, and reliability requirements. The framework must support modern JavaScript/TypeScript features, provide excellent developer experience, and handle enterprise-scale healthcare workloads.

## Decision Drivers

* **Performance**: Healthcare APIs require sub-100ms response times for critical operations
* **Type Safety**: Healthcare data requires strict type checking to prevent data corruption
* **Security**: HIPAA compliance requires robust security features and audit trails
* **Developer Experience**: Modern TypeScript support with excellent tooling
* **Ecosystem**: Rich plugin ecosystem for authentication, validation, and documentation
* **Maintainability**: Long-term support and active community
* **Bundle Size**: Minimal runtime footprint for efficient deployment

## Considered Options

* **Fastify** - Performance-focused framework with TypeScript-first design
* **Express** - Mature, widely-adopted framework with extensive ecosystem
* **Hono** - Ultra-lightweight framework optimized for edge computing
* **Koa** - Minimalist framework from Express team with async/await support
* **NestJS** - Enterprise framework with decorators and dependency injection

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen option**: "Fastify", because it provides the optimal combination of performance, TypeScript support, and security features required for healthcare applications.

### Consequences

#### Positive

* **Superior Performance**: 2-3x faster than Express in benchmarks, critical for healthcare response times
* **TypeScript Native**: First-class TypeScript support with automatic type inference
* **JSON Schema Validation**: Built-in request/response validation prevents data corruption
* **Plugin Architecture**: Rich ecosystem with healthcare-relevant plugins (JWT, CORS, rate limiting)
* **OpenAPI Integration**: Excellent Swagger/OpenAPI support for API documentation
* **Security Focus**: Built-in security features and audit trail capabilities
* **Developer Experience**: Excellent IDE support and error messages

#### Negative

* **Learning Curve**: Different API than Express, requiring team training
* **Smaller Community**: Less Stack Overflow content compared to Express
* **Plugin Compatibility**: Some Express middleware requires adapters
* **Breaking Changes**: More frequent major version updates than Express

### Implementation Notes

* Use `@fastify/autoload` for automatic route discovery
* Implement JSON Schema validation for all endpoints
* Configure `@fastify/swagger` for API documentation
* Use `@fastify/jwt` for authentication with refresh token rotation
* Enable `@fastify/rate-limit` for DDoS protection
* Configure `@fastify/helmet` for security headers

### Migration Strategy

* Phase 1: Basic Fastify setup with core routes
* Phase 2: Add authentication, validation, and security plugins
* Phase 3: Performance optimization and monitoring
* Phase 4: Advanced features (WebSockets, file uploads)

## Validation

* **Performance Metrics**: Monitor P95 response times < 100ms for critical endpoints
* **Error Rates**: Maintain < 0.1% server error rate in production
* **Type Safety**: Zero runtime type errors in production
* **Security Compliance**: Pass HIPAA compliance audit
* **Developer Satisfaction**: Positive team feedback on development experience
